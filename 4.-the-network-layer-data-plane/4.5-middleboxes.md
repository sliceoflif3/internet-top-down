# 4.5 Middleboxes

Middleboxes is defined as:

_“any intermediary box performing functions apart from normal, standard functions of an IP router on the data path between a source host and destination host”_

We can broadly identify three types of services performed by middleboxes:

**NAT Translation**. As we saw in Section 4.3.4, NAT boxes implement private network addressing, rewriting datagram header IP addresses and port numbers.

**Security Services.** Firewalls block traffic based on header-field values or redirect packets for additional processing, such as deep packet inspection (DPI). Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are able to detect predetermined patterns and filter packets accordingly. Application-level e-mail filters block e-mails considered to be junk, phishing or otherwise posing a security threat.

**Performance Enhancement.** These middleboxes perform services such as compression, content caching, and load balancing of service requests (e.g., an HTTP request, or a search engine query) to one of a set of servers that can provide the desired service.
