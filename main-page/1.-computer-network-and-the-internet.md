# 1. Computer network and the internet

### 1.1 What is the internet?

#### 1.1.1 A Nuts-and-Bolts description

The Internet is a computer network that interconnects billions of computing devices throughout the world.

In Internet jargon, all of these devices (TVs, gaming consoles, thermostats, home security systems, home appliances, watches, eye glasses, cars, traffic control systems, and more) are called **hosts** or **end systems**.

End systems are connected together by a network of **communication links** and **packet switches**.

Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the **transmission rate** of a link measured in bits/second.

When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The resulting packages of information, known as **packets** in the jargon of computer networks, are then sent through the network to the destination end system, where they are reassembled into the original data.

A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links. Packet switches come in many shapes and flavors, but the two most prominent types in todayâ€™s Internet are **routers** and **link-layer switches**.

The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system is known as a **route** or **path** through the network.
